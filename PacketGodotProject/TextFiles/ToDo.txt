[///] Make a timer which
	a] Checks if a round is occurring
	b] starts a new round if one isn't occurring
[///] Wait a few seconds after the results are outputted
[///] Make Scanning Packet take a few seconds
>>> Make it obvious that it is scanning
[///] Show points earned
[///] Determine how points are earned and lost


[] Ty's TCP/UDP 
[] Ty's unpacking of the information and displaying it
[] Proper Packet creation

[] Incorporating protocols
[] Make buttons disabled between rounds

[] Find ways to make it fun
	a] Add more actions to do?
	b] Focus more on TCP/UDP phase 
		i] IDEA!!! UDP brings up russian roulette
		or the dinosaur game. TCP brings up Real Time Action.
			Only if enough time and speak to Ty first.  
			RTS game would be selecting keys when they plop up
			Russian Roulette would just be button mashing
	c] Oooh a hashing minigame -> maybe packets are encrypted so a 
	minigame pops up inorder to unencrypt it. Maybe dinosaur game? 
	Like jumping hurdles. Simple to make. Adds more points if this
	has to happen. Uhh another idea is idk. Ask Ty
[] Add timeout for each round
[] Disable buttons between rounds
[] After a number of rounds, change the valid ip range (?)
[] Figure out how long rounds should go for
[] Do a proper end once the round takes too long
