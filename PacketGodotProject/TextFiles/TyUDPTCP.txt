Ok Ty, so here is the premis of the TCP UDP part of the game

After a packet is accepted (which i have coded in), the TCP/UDP function will be called

What this needs to do is
FIRST -> It needs to make the terminal for TCP/UDP visible 
(i'll do that. You look at it for future reference just in 
case i need you to do something similar)

SECOND -> Connect signals from the TCP / UDP buttons to the 
PacketMainScene.gd script and create functions. Again I'll 
do this, but for future reference what you'll want to do is 
go to the node (ask me if you dont know what that is), select
signals on the RIGHT PANEL, then click connect. I'll show you tmr

This is what you need to code in

THIRD -> In the UDP (yeet the baby) part, you need to 
   a] Generate a random number (very easy. I have done that many
	  times in the script and it is in godot documentation)
   b] Base on this number, do an if statement on whether if it will
	  succeed to send.
   c] Go to the round_information_dict, and go to the Allies dict 
	  within it, and change the details accordingly. 
   d] At the end, call the described what happened function
