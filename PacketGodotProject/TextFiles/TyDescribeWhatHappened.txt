Ok so this function, very simple

FIRST -> Grab the dictionary which holds all the 
information -> round_information or something like that

SECOND -> From there, access the different pieces of information
and determine whether it should be displayed. For example, either 
Deny or Allow should be the false, and the other will contain information.
If Allow contains information, further dissect that look at the 
information accordingly
   a] Always display whether they were correct in there choice (Valid choice : true / false)

THIRD -> Calls the display_text function or whatever it 
calls, and passes the text into there. Remember that it
shouldn't be too long otherwise it won't fit in there. 
Along with that, if you want to start a new line, put \n
